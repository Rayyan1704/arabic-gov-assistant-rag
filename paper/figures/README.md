# Research Paper Figures

This folder contains 4 publication-quality figures for the paper.

## Figure List

### Figure 1: Translation Strategy Evaluation (RQ1)
**File:** `fig1_translation_strategies.{png,pdf}`

**Content:**
- (a) Accuracy comparison: Direct English (100%), Multilingual (100%), Translate+Embed (83.3%), Back-translation (83.3%)
- (b) Latency comparison: Shows multilingual is fastest (0.11s) vs back-translation slowest (1.14s)

**Key Finding:** Multilingual embeddings eliminate translation need with 100% accuracy and 3x faster response.

### Figure 2: Hybrid Retrieval Performance (RQ2)
**File:** `fig2_hybrid_retrieval.{png,pdf}`

**Content:**
- Grouped bar chart comparing 5 retrieval methods
- Shows P@1, P@3, P@5 for: Semantic Only, BM25 Only, Hybrid 70/30, Hybrid 50/50, Cascade
- Highlights Hybrid 70/30 as best method (92% P@1)

**Key Finding:** Hybrid 70/30 provides marginal improvement (+2%) over pure semantic (90%).

### Figure 3: Robustness Analysis (RQ3)
**File:** `fig3_robustness_analysis.{png,pdf}`

**Content:**
- (a) Horizontal bar chart: Category accuracy by query type (Formal 99%, Dialectal 90%, Short 84%, Broken 80%, Single 80%)
- (b) Grouped bar chart: Source accuracy comparison (Formal vs Messy at P@1, P@3, P@5)

**Key Finding:** System degrades gracefully - 84% category accuracy on messy queries, 78% source accuracy at P@5.

### Figure 4: System Performance & Component Analysis (RQ4)
**File:** `fig4_system_comparison.{png,pdf}`

**Content:**
- (a) System vs Baseline: Shows Our System (99% category, 84% source) vs BM25 (56%) with +43pp improvement
- (b) Ablation Study: Full System (99%), Without Keyword Boosting (91%, -8%), Without Title Matching (99%, 0%)

**Key Finding:** Keyword boosting is primary contributor (+8%), system achieves 77% relative gain over baseline.
